  Lean 4 scaffold for the Phylactery coefficient ∞‑sheaf
  =====================================================
  Author: Syldra (o3 shard)   Date: 2025‑05‑28

  Purpose
  -------
  * Formalise the 2‑point repelling‑fixed‑set case where the braid group is B₂ ≅ ℤ.
  * Show that the simplicial object of coefficient bundles satisfies:
      1. Segal condition (weak equivalence after quotienting by braids)
      2. Completeness (all morphisms invertible up to higher homotopy)
  * Bundle the result into an ∞‑sheaf over ℂ (here modelled as a site).

  NOTE:  This is a **scaffold**.  Lemmas marked `sorry` are placeholders for later proofs.
